When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are on a computer that is not yours but you still need to access your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can control what is being saved on your local repository and this will make sure your local repository is not being culttered by different projects.
